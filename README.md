# Airbnb Clone Project

The Airbnb Clone is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with backend systems, database design, API development, and CI/CD practices while working in a collaborative setup.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: Backend framework for API development
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Relational database management
- **GraphQL**: Query language for efficient data retrieval
- **Docker**: Containerization for scalable deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
# Task 1: Team Roles and Responsibilities

In a real-world Airbnb Clone project, different roles work together to ensure smooth development, deployment, and maintenance of the platform. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer
- Designs and implements RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- Manages business logic, authentication, and authorization.
- Ensures backend scalability and performance.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
- Designs database schema (entities, relationships, constraints).
- Optimizes queries for performance and reliability.
- Ensures data integrity, security, and backups.

### 3. Frontend Developer
- Builds the user-facing interface.
- Integrates frontend with backend APIs.
- Ensures responsive, accessible, and user-friendly UI.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
- Sets up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Manages containerization (Docker) and cloud environments.
- Monitors server health and performance.

### 5. Project Manager
- Coordinates team efforts and timelines.
- Defines deliverables and milestones.
- Ensures communication and documentation.
# Task 2: Technology Stack Overview

The Airbnb Clone project uses a modern stack to ensure scalability, maintainability, and developer efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A Python-based web framework used to build RESTful and GraphQL APIs with built-in authentication and ORM support.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database management systems (RDBMS) for storing structured data like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool to package applications and ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation tool used to run tests, lint code, and deploy the application automatically on code changes.
